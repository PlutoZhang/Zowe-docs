# Project Zoe overview

Project Zoe offers modern interfaces to interact with z/OS and allows you to work with z/OS in a way that is identical to what you experience on cloud platforms today. You can use these interfaces as delivered or through programmable extensions that are created by clients or third-party vendors.

Project Zoe consists of the following three main components. Each component provides a different interface.

* zLUX, which contains a browser-based user interface \(UI\) that provides a full screen interactive experience. It includes all interactions that exist in 3270 terminals and web interfaces like z/OSMF.
* Explorer server, which provides a range of APIs for the management of jobs, data sets, z/OS UNIX System Services files, and persistent data.
* Zoe Brightside, which provides a command line interface that lets you interact with the mainframe remotely and use common tools such as Integrated Development Environments \(IDEs\), shell commands, bash scripts, and build tools for mainframe development.

For details of each component, see the corresponding section.
