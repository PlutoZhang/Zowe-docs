# Navigating MVD


From the Mainframe Virtual Desktop (MVD), you can access the Project Giza applications. 

## Accessing the MVD

From a supported browser, open the MVD at `https://myhost:httpsPort/ZLUX/plugins/com.rs.mvd/web/index.html`
    
where:

-   *myHost* is the host on which you are running the Giza Node Server.
-   *httpPort* is the value that was assigned to `node.http.port` in `zluxserver.json`.
-   *httpsPort* is the value that was assigned to *node.https.port* in `zluxserver.json`.
    For example, if you run the Giza Node Server on host *myhost* and the value that is assigned to *node.http.port* in `zluxserver.json` is 12345, you would specify `https://myhost:12345/ZLUX/plugins/com.rs.mvd/web/index.htm`.


## Logging into and out of the MVD

2. Press Enter. Upon authentication of your user name and password, the desktop opens.

To log out, click the the avatar in the lower right corner and click **Sign Out**.
