# Verifying your system meets the software requirements

Your system must meet the software requirements for Mainframe Virtual Desktop.

1.   Confirm that your environment meets the requirements for Project Giza: 
    -   z/OS Version 2.2 or later, and whatever maintenance is required by the Node.js and Java installations, and 833 MB of HFS file space for the installation.
    -   To verify that the most recent version of Java Version 8 is installed on z/OS, type **java -version**.
    -   Confirm that the machine from which you plan to run the Mainframe Virtual Desktop runs one of the supported browsers:

        -   Chrome version 54 or later
        -   Firefox version 44 or later
        -   Microsoft Edge
        **Note:** Microsoft Internet Explorer is not yet supported at any version level.

2.   If your environment does not meet these requirements, consult your system administrator. 

When you have confirmed that your environment meets the software requirements, go on to [Confirming that Node.js is installed](mvd-instconfirmnodejsinstalled.md).
