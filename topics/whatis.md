# What is Project Zoe

Today's information technology (IT) organization must be both innovative and agile, which comes from the creation of new solutions using various building blocks of computing capabilities. z/OS-based resources represent a huge existing asset to companies and are one of the key building blocks for customer solutions. Newer cloud-based services are another important building block. The challenge is how best to mix the established z/OS computing resources with cloud-based services to facilitate the needed innovation.

Cloud services have created a set of interfaces and provided common work patterns that are used by today's programmers and system administrators. Project Zoe provides interfaces on z/OS that are intended to be identical to what programmers and system administrators would experience on cloud platforms today. Project Zoe also provides ways for individuals to extend the work patterns that they use today on cloud to the z/OS environment. The goal is drive innovation through the integration of z/OS-based services and cloud services.

Project Zoe is focused on the integration of z/OS into the wider enterprise. The purpose is to allow IT staff to work with the mainframe as they would in any other cloud-based environment, so that the staff with typical understanding of cloud interfaces can use z/OS. The more the staff are able to use the platform, the faster the needs of the enterprise can be met.

Project Zoe contains a desktop, browser-based user interface (UI) that provides a full screen interactive experience. The web UI has the following features:

- The web UI works with the underlying REST APIs for data, jobs, and subsystem, but presents the information in a full screen mode as compared to the command line interface.
- The web UI makes use of the leading-edge web presentation technology and is also extensible through web UI plug-ins to capture and present any variety of information.
- The web UI includes common z/OS developer or system programmer tasks such as an editor for common text-based files like REXX or JCL along with general purpose data set actions for both Unix System Services (USS) and Partitioned Data Sets (PDS) plus Job Entry System (JES) logs.

Project Zoe enables you to access z/OS data, jobs, and subsystems through REST APIs. These APIs have the following features:

- These APIs are described by the Open API Specification allowing them to be incorporated to any standard-based REST API developer tool or API management process.
- These APIs can be exploited by off-platform applications with proper security controls.

Project Zoe provides a command line interface that allows interactive access to those same data, jobs, and subsystem, but extends the capability in additional ways. You can use the command line interface to perform the following tasks:

- Edit files, submit jobs, and issue commands which are the common z/OS tasks.
- Script the commands to perform a series of steps. You can write scripts to automate a variety of z/OS tasks to speed such things as application deployment, provisioning of new run-time environments or job submission and capturing of results.
- Use new ways to work with z/OS assets such as using file editors of the system programmer choose or any number of the tools not typically associated with z/OS. The command line interface comes with z/OS support but can be extended to support any other z/OS-based application or subsystem.
