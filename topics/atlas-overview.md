# Explorer server overview (test)

The explorer server is a z/OS® RESTful web service and deployment architecture for z/OS microservices. The server is implemented as a Liberty Profile web application that uses z/OSMF services to provide a range of APIs for the management of jobs, data sets, z/OS UNIX™ System Services files, and persistent data.

The explorer server can be used by any client application that calls its RESTful APIs directly.

As a deployment architecture, the explorer server accommodates the installation of other z/Tool microservices into its Liberty instance. These microservices can be used by explorer server APIs and client applications.
