# Installation roadmap

Installing Project Zoe involves several steps that you must complete in the appropriate sequence. Review the installation roadmap that presents the task-flow for preparing your environment and installing and configuring Project Zoe before you begin the installation process.

| Tasks | Description
| --- | ---
| 1. Prepare your environment to meet the installation requirements. | See [System requirements](planinstall.md).
| 2. Obtain the Zoe installation files. | The Zoe installation files are released in a PAX file format. The PAX file contains the runtimes and the scripts to install and launch the z/OS runtime and the runtime for Zoe Brightside.  For how to download and prepare the file to install the Zoe runtime, see [Obtaining the installation files](zoegettingstarted.md).
| 3. Allocate enough space for the installation. | For successful installation of Project Zoe, your PC must contain the required space. The installation process requires approximately 1 GB of available space. Once installed, zLUX requires approximately 50 MB of space before configuration, explorer server requires approximately 200 MB, and Zoe Brightside requires approximately 25 MB.
| 4. Install components of Project Zoe. | To install zLUX and explorer server on z/OS, see [Installing the Zoe runtime on z/OS](zoeinstall.md). To install Zoe Brightside on PC, see [Installing Zoe Brightside](cli-installcli.md).
| 5. Verify that Project Zoe is installed correctly. | To verify that zLUX and explorer server are installed correctly, see [Verifying installation](verify.md). To verify that Zoe Brightside is installed correctly, see [Testing connection to z/OSMF](cli-validateInstallation.md).
| 6. Optional: Troubleshoot problems that occurred during installation. | See  [Troubleshooting installing the Zoe runtime](zoeinstalltroubleshoot.md) and [Troubleshooting installing Zoe Brightside](cli-troubleshootinginstallingcli.md).

To uninstall Project Zoe, see [Uninstalling Project Zoe](uninstall.md).
