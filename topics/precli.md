# Prerequisites for Brightside CLI

Meet the following prerequisites before you install Brightside CLI on your PC:

- Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime environment on which we
architected Brightside CLI. You use the Node.js package manager (npm)
to install Brightside CLI. After you install Node.js, you can then
install Brightside CLI using the Node.js package
manager. 

- You can install Brightside CLI on any Windows, macOS, and Linux operating system that supports Node.js version 6 or
later.

- Before you can use Brightside CLI to interact with the
mainframe, a systems programmer must install and configure IBM z/OSMF in
your environment. For more information about how systems programmers and
security administrators perform the z/OSMF configuration, see [Overview of the z/OS Management Facility Configuration Process](cli-overviewzosmfconfig.md).

**Note:** CA Technologies does not maintain the prerequisite software
that Brightside CLI requires. You are responsible for updating Node.js
and other prerequisites on your personal computer or workstation. We
recommend that you update Node.js regularly to the latest Long Term
Support (LTS) version.
