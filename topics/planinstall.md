# System requirements

Before installing Project Zoe, ensure that your environment meets all of the prerequisites.

1. Ensure that IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) is installed and configured correctly. z/OSMF is a prerequisite for the Project Zoe microservice that must be installed and running before you use Project Zoe. For details, see [z/OSMF configuration](../topics/prezosmf.md).

2. Review component specific requirements.
