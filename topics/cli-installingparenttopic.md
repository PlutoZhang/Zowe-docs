# Installing Zoe Brightside
To use Zoe Brightside, systems programmers and security administrators set up and configure IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF) so that Zoe Brightside can communicate with z/OS systems. After the z/OSMF configuration tasks are complete, application developers can install Zoe Brightside on their PC and issue a command to verify that the system is configured properly.

**Important\!** The [IBM z/OS Management Facility](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.2.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r2.izu/izu.htm) guide on the IBM Knowledge Center is your primary source of information about how to install and  configure z/OSMF. Throughout the IBM procedures, we provide Zoe Brightside-specific tips or requirements. We recommend that you open IBM documentation in a separate browser tab.
