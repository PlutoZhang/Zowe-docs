# Using Giza
You can use the various components of Giza to enhance z/OS user experience:

- Giza MVD provides a framework for building and sharing extension apps using web services and modern UI toolkits such as AngularJS. It includes all interactions that exist in 3270 terminals and web interfaces like z/OSMF.

- Giza REST APIs provide a range of APIs for the management of jobs, data sets, z/OS UNIX System Services files, and persistent data.

- Giza Brightside Command Line Interface (Brightside CLI) lets you interact with the mainframe in a format that is natively familiar to you and use common tools such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), shell commands, bash scripts, and build tools for mainframe development.
