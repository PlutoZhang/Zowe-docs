# Using Giza
You can use the various components of Giza to enhance z/OS user experience.

Giza MVD provides a framework for building and sharing extension apps using web services and modern UI toolkits such as AngularJS. It includes all interactions that exist in 3270 terminals and web interfaces like z/OSMF.

Giza Brightside Command Line Interface (Brightside CLI) lets you interact with the mainframe in a format that is natively familiar to you and use common tools such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), shell commands, bash scripts, and build tools for mainframe development.

Giza REST APIs provide a range of APIs for the management of jobs, data sets, z/OS UNIX System Services files, and persistent data.
