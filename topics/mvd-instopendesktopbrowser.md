# Opening the project GIZA desktop in a browser

You can open the Project Giza desktop in any supported browser.

1.   In a supported browser, open the Project Giza desktop at `zluxHost:httpPort` or `zluxHost:httpsPort` 

    where:

    -   `zluxHost` is the host on which you ran the Project Giza Node.js server.
    -   `httpPort` is the value that was assigned to `node.http.port` in zluxserver.json.
    -   `httpsPort` is the value that was assigned to `node.https.port` in zluxserver.json.
    For example, if you ran the Project Giza Node.js server on host `myhost` and the value that is assigned to `node.http.port` in zluxserver.json is 12345, you would specify myhost:12345.

2.   Browse the interface.
