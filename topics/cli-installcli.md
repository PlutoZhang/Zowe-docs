## Installing Zoe Brightside from package

Install Zoe Brightside on PCs that are running a Windows, Linux, or macOS operating system.

**Follow these steps:**

1. [Address the prerequisites](cli-precli.md).

2. [Obtain the Project Zoe installation files](zoegettingstarted.md), which includes the brightside.tgz file. Use FTP to distribute the brightside.tgz file to client workstations.
    Users can now install Zoe Brightside on their PC.

3.  Open a command line window. For example, Windows Command Prompt. Browse to the directory where you downloaded the Zoe Brightside installation package (.tgz file). Issue the following command to install Brightside CLI on your PC:

    ```
    npm install -g <file_name>
    ```

    **Note:** On Linux systems, you might need to append `sudo` to your
    `npm` commands so that you can issue the install and uninstall
    commands. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Installing Zoe Brightside](cli-troubleshootinginstallingcli.md).

4.  Create a `zosmf` profile so that you can issue commands that communicate with z/OSMF.

    **Tip:** Zoe Brightside profiles contain information that is required
    for the product to interact with remote systems. For example, host
    name, port, and user ID. Profiles let you target unique systems,
    regions, or instances for a command. Most Zoe Brightside [command
    groups](cli-commandgroups.md) require a Zoe Brightside
    `zosmf` profile.
