3.  Open a command line window. For example, Windows Command Prompt. Browse to the directory where you downloaded the Zoe Brightside installation package (.tgz file). Issue the following command to install Brightside CLI on your PC:

    npm install -g <file_name>
    ```
    
    **Note:** On Linux systems, you might need to append `sudo` to your
