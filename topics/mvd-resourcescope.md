# Resource Scope

Data is stored within the Configuration Dataservice according to the Scope chosen.

The intent of Scope within the Dataservice is to facilitate company-wide administration and privilege management of zLUX data.

When a user requests a resource, the resource that is retrieved is override or an aggregation of the broader Scopes that encompass the Scope they are viewing the data from.

When a user stores an resource, the resource is stored within a Scope but only if the user has access privilege to update within that Scope.

Scope is one of the following:

* **Product**: Configuration defaults that come with the product. Cannot be modified.
* **Site**: Data that can be used between multiple instances of the zLUX server.
* **Instance**: Data within an individual zLUX server.
* **Group**: Data shared between multiple users in a group (**Pending**)
* **User**: Data for an individual user (**Pending**)

**Note: While Authorization tuning can allow for settings such as GET from Instance to work without login, User and Group scope queries will be rejected if not logged in because they must pull resources from a specific user. Because of this, User and Group Scopes will not be functional until the Security Framework is available.**

Where **Product** is the broadest scope and **User** is the narrowest scope.

When using scope **User**, the service will manage configuration for your particular username, using the authentication of the session. This way, the **User** scope is always mapped to your current username.


Consider a case where a user wants to access preferences for their text editor. One way they could do this is to use the REST API to retrieve the settings resource from the **Instance** scope.

The **Instance** scope might contain editor defaults that their administrator set. But, if there were no defaults in Instance, then the data in **Group** and finally **User** would be checked.

Therefore, the data the user receives would be no broader than what is stored in the **Instance** scope, but may have only been the settings they had saved within their own **User** scope if the broader scopes had no data for the resource.

Later, perhaps the user wants to save changes, and they try to save in the **Instance** scope. Most likely, this is rejected due to preferences by the administrator to disallow changes to the **Instance** scope by ordinary users.
