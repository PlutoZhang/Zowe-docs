# System requirements for explorer server

-   z/OS® Version 2.1 or later.
-   64-bit Java™ 8 JRE or later.

## Pre-installation checklist

The following information is required during the installation process. Make the decisions before you install the explorer server.

-   The HFS directory where you will install the Zoe project, for example, `/var/zoe`.
-   The HFS directory path that contains a 64-bit Java™ 8 JRE.
-   The API Mediation HTTP and HTTPS port numbers. You will be asked for 3 unique port numbers.
-   The user ID that runs the Zoe started task.

    **Tip:** Use the same user ID that runs the z/OSMF IZUSVR1 task, or a user ID with equivalent authorizations.
