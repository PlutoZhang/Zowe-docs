# Using Atlas REST APIs

Atlas REST APIs provide a range of REST APIs through a Swagger defined description, and a simple interface to specify API endpoint parameters and request bodies along with the response body and return code. With Atlas REST APIs, you can see the available API endpoints and try the endpoints within a browser. Swagger documentation is available from an internet browser with a URL, for example, https://your.host:atlas-port/ibm/api/explorer.
