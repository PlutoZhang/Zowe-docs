## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites apply to all of the scenarios that are
contained in this section. When a scenario contains prerequisites that
are unique to the scenario, we note them directly in the article.

  - z/OSMF installed and configured on the z/OS system that you want to
    access.

  - Brightside CLI is installed on your computer.

  - An editor or integrated development environment (IDE) is installed
    on your computer (for example, Visual Studio Code). A JCL/COBOL
    syntax highlighting plug-in is recommended.

  - You have a Brightside CLI profile that can communicate with the
    z/OS system that you want to access. The commands that you
    use target the system that is specified in your Brightside
    CLI profile. You can switch profiles to target different
    systems.
    
    **Tip:** The syntax examples shown in these scenarios use a small
    subset of the commands and options that Brightside CLI includes. We
    encourage you to explore the Brightside CLI help to learn about the
    available Brightside CLI commands and options.
    
    Issue the `--help` command after any Brightside CLI command to see
    more available options. For more information about getting help, see
    [How to Display Brightside CLI Help](./topics/cli-howtodisplaybrightsidehelp.md).
