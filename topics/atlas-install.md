# Installing Atlas

Installing Atlas involves obtaining the Atlas Archive, running the install script, and configuring files.

Before installing Atlas, ensure that your environment meets the [prerequisites for Atlas](topics/atlas-prereqs.md).

To install Atlas, complete the following steps:

1. Download the Giza PAX from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gizafoundation/Downloads/releases).

2. Extract the Giza PAX to reveal the Atlas PAX and associated files.

3. Transfer the following files to z/OS® System:

    -   The Atlas PAX archive that contains Liberty Profile binaries and the Atlas application.
    -   The Atlas Install script

    **Note:** The Atlas Install script is an ASCII file. If the Install script is transferred by using FTP, the Install script is converted into the appropriate format for the server. If the Install script is transferred by using SCP or SFTP, the Install script is not converted, and it should be converted by taking the action specified in the **Important** note below.

    Alternatively, transfer the Atlas archive to your z/OS system, and extract the archive. The Atlas archive contains the following files:

    -   The Atlas PAX archive that contains Liberty Profile binaries and the Atlas application
    -   The Atlas Install script
    -   This User's Guide
    -   The readme file

    Extracting the archive on the server does not convert the Install script. The Install script should be converted by taking the action specified in the **Important** note below.

    **Important:** To convert the Install script from ASCII into the standard EBCDIC code page, use `ICONV`. For example,

    ```
    iconv -f ISO8859-1 -t IBM-1047 atlas-wlp-package-0.0.1.sh > atlas-wlp-package-EBCDIC.sh
    ```

    **Note:** Transfer the PAX archive and the Install script in binary mode to the Atlas installation directory that is chosen during planning, for example, `/var/atlas`, or wherever you choose to install Atlas.

4. Run the Atlas install script.

    The install script must be transferred to the same Atlas installation directory of the Atlas PAX archive. Run the install script in the installation directory with a user ID that has the authority to:

    -   Unpack the Atlas PAX archive and install Atlas into the installation directory, for example, `/var/atlas`. About 205 MB is needed to unpack the archive and more space is needed for Liberty operation and logging.
    -   Set the file group ownership to IZUADMIN.
    -   Create symbolic links to the files that z/OSMF owns.

    Therefore, use super user authority to run the Atlas install script.

5. Change the ownership of Atlas installation directory and files.

    The user who runs the Atlas Liberty server needs the access to the Atlas installation directory and files. You can use the same user ID that runs the z/OSMF IZUSVR1 started task to run the Atlas Liberty server. By default, it is the user IZUSVR.

    To change the ownership of the Atlas installation directory and files, enter the following z/OS UNIX™ System Services command from the Atlas installation directory:

    ```
    chown -R IZUSVR *
    ```

    You might need super user authority to run this command. Use an alternative user ID if you chose not to use the default z/OSMF IZUSVR1 started task user.

6. Create a member FEKATLS in your system PROCLIB data set.

    The install script creates a file that is called `FEKATLS.jcl` is created in your Atlas installation directory. Copy this file to a system PROCLIB data set by using the following z/OS UNIX System Services command:

    ```
    cp FEKATLS.jcl "//'hlq.PROCLIB(FEKATLS)'"
    ```

    The FEKATLS procedure starts a Liberty profile server running the Atlas microservice application.

7. Configure the FEKATLS started procedure.

    To run the FEKATLS procedure as the user IZUSVR, define the procedure to the STARTED class by using RACF® or equivalent, for example:

    ```
    •	RDEF STARTED (FEKATLS.*) STDATA(USER(IZUSVR) GROUP(IZUADMIN))
    •	SETR RACLIST(STARTED) REFRESH
    ```

    Here is an example of the FEKATLS procedure JCL:

    ```

8. Add Atlas users to the z/OSMF users group \(IZUUSER\).

    Atlas uses z/OSMF to access data sets, z/OS UNIX System Services files, and job spool files. To use these z/OSMF services, Atlas users must be authorized to z/OSMF resources. For more information, see the *IBM z/OS Management Facility Configuration Guide*, Appendix A.

    To add Atlas users to the z/OSMF IZUUSER group, use RACF or equivalent. For example,

    ```
    CONNECT userid GROUP(IZUUSER) AUTH(USE)
    ```

9. Start the Atlas server.

    To start Atlas manually, enter the `START` operator command:

    ```
    S FEKATLS
    ```

    To start Atlas automatically at IPL, add the `START` command to your active COMMNDxx parmlib member.

10. Optional: Change your language in Atlas by adding the following line to the `jvm.options` file, for example,

    ```
    -Duser.language=de
    ```

    where `de` can be replaced with other language codes.
