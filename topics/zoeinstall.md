Zoe uses two main server, the zLUX server for the virtual desktop environment, and the explorer-server for the JES, MVS and USS explorers.

The install script lays these down into the ZOE_ROOT_DIR of the install

 ```
/zlux-example-server
/explorer-server
 ```

 The last step of the install creates a PROCLIB called ZOESVR.  This is created in the /scripts folder in the directory that the zoe runtime is installed into.
