# Creating a zLUX application plug-in

A zLUX application plug-in is a separately installable collection of files that can provide a set of web resources \(JavaScript, HTML, and so on\), which can be presented in the user interface. These resources can be presented as a window \(or embedded panel\), a set of RESTful services, or both RESTful services and user interfaces.

Before you can begin building a zLUX application plug-in, you must set the environment variables that are necessary to support the plug-in environment.

`sample-app` is a sample application plug-in with which you can experiment.
