# Installing Project Giza

This topic contains instructions for downloading and installing Project Giza.

**Obtaining Project Giza installation media**

To download and unpack the installation media, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Project Giza download page](https://github.com/gizafoundation/Downloads/releases) in GitHub.
2. Click the file with the `.pax` extension (for example, project_giza-0_8_0.pax) and save the file to your preferred location.
3. Transfer the PAX file as-is to the USS file system on the mainframe using FTP in binary mode or SFTP. 
    
   **Note:** SCP will not transfer correctly as the PAX file must be binary, not txt transferred.
4. Unpack the PAX file by issuing the following command.  
   ```
   pax -ppx -rf <pax-file-name>.pax
   ```  
   Where _pax-file-name_ is a variable that indicates the name of the PAX file you downloaded.
