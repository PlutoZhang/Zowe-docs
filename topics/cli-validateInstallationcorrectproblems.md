# Correcting problems with your Brightside CLI profile

You can use the results of the validate profile command to troubleshoot and fix problems with your z/OSMF configuration. The result of each test returns as *OK*, *Warning*, or *Failed*. If you receive a *Warning* or *Failed* result on a test, you can refer to IBM documentation for information on how to configure that particular REST API. For information on which of the z/OSMF REST APIs Brightside CLI uses, see [z/OSMF requirements](prezosmf.md). We provide links to IBM documentation for configuring each REST API. 

For example, you receive a *Failed* result on the "Issue Console
command" task. Refer to the list of REST APIs in [z/OSMF requirements](prezosmf.md) and follow the links to
the corresponding IBM documentation for the z/OS console services API.
