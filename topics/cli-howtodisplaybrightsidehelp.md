## Displaying top-level help
To begin using the product, open a command line window and issue the following command to view the top-level help descriptions:

## Help structure
The help displays the following types of information:
  - **Description:** An explanation of the functionality for the command group, action, or option that you specified in a `--help` command.
  - **Usage:** The syntax for the command. Refer to usage to determine the expected hierarchical structure of a command.
  - **Options:** Flags that you can append to the end of a command to specify particular values or booleans. For example, the volume size for a data set that you want to create. 
  - **Global Options:** Flags that you can append to any command in Zoe Brightside. For example, the `--help` flag is a global option. 

## Displaying command group, action, and object help
You can use the `--help` global option get more information about a specific command group, action, or object. Use the following syntax to display group-level help and learn more about specific command groups (for example, *zos-jobs* and *zos-files*):
