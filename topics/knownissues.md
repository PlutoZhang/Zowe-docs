# Known issues

When you initially open the MVD, a security message alerts you that you are attempting to open a site that has an invalid HTTPS certificate. Other apps within the MVD may also encounter this message. To prevent this message, add the URLs that you see to your list of trusted sites.

NOTE: If you clear the browser cache, you must add the URL to your trusted sites again.
