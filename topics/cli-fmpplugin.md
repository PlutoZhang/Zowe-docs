# Zoe Brightside plug-in for CA File Master Plus

The Zoe Brightside plug-in for CA File Master Plus is a file management
and data manipulation tool. Zoe Brightside speeds up file creation and
manipulates virtual storage access method (VSAM), sequential and
partitioned data sets. Zoe Brightside also supports symbolic access to
data with layouts, and data manipulation such as selection of records in
data sets.

Zoe Brightside allows you to perform commands on multiple mainframe
applications at once from one command line window, without the need to
establish several mainframe sessions.
