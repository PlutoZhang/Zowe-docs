# Project Zoe overview

Project Zoe offers modern interfaces to interact with z/OS and allows you to work with z/OS in a way that is identical to what you experience on cloud platforms today. You can use these interfaces as delivered or through programmable extensions that are created by clients or third-party vendors.

Project Zoe consists of the following three main components. Each component provides a different interface.

- zLUX, which contains a browser-based user interface (UI) that provides a full screen interactive experience
- Explorer server, which enables you to access z/OS data, jobs, and subsystems through REST APIs
- Brightside Command Line Interface (Brightside CLI), which provides a command line interface that allows interactive access to those same data, jobs, and subsystem, but extends the capability in additional ways.

For details of each component, see the corresponding section.
