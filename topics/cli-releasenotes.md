# Zoe Brightside overview
Zoe Brightside is a command-line interface that lets application developers interact with the mainframe in a familiar format. Zoe Brightside helps to increase overall productivity, reduce the learning curve for developing mainframe applications, and exploit the ease-of-use of off-platform tools. Zoe Brightside lets application developers use common tools such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), shell commands, bash scripts, and build tools for mainframe development. It provides a set of utilities and services for application developers that want to become efficient in supporting and building z/OS applications quickly.

Zoe Brightside provides the following benefits:

  - Enables and encourages developers with limited z/OS expertise to build, modify, and debug z/OS applications.
  - Fosters the development of new and innovative tools from a PC that can interact with z/OS.
  - Ensure that business critical applications running on z/OS can be maintained and supported by existing and generally available software development resources.
  - Provides a more streamlined way to build software that integrates with z/OS.
