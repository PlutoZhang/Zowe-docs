# Uninstall Zoe Brightside
You can uninstall Zoe Brightside when you no longer want to use the product.

    ```
     bright profiles list <profileType>
    ```
    **Example:**
    
    ``` 
    $ bright profiles list zosmf
    The following profiles were found for the module zosmf:

    $

3.  Delete all of the profiles that are listed for the command group by issuing the following command: 
    
    **Tip:** For this command, use the results of the `list`
    command.    
    **Note:** When you issue the `delete` command, it deletes the
    specified profile and its credentials from the credential vault in your PC's operating system.
    
    ``` 
    bright profiles delete <profileType> <profileName> --force  
    ```
      **Example:**

    profiles.
