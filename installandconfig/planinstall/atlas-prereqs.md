# System requirements for explorer server

* z/OS® Version 2.2 or later.
* 64-bit Java™ 8 JRE or later.
* [IBM® z/OS Management Facility \(z/OSMF\)](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.izu/izu.htm) must be installed and running. See [z/OSMF configuration]().

## Pre-installation checklist

The following information is required during the installation process. Make the decisions before you install the explorer server.

* The HFS directory where you install the explorer server, for example, `/var/atlas`.
* The HFS directory path that contains a 64-bit Java™ 8 JRE.
* The z/OSMF installation directory `/lib` that contains `derby.jar`, for example, `/usr/lpp/zosmf/lib`.
* The z/OSMF configuration user directory path that contains the z/OSMF `/bootstrap.properties`, `/jvm.security.override.properties`, and `/resources/security/ltpa.keys` files.
* The explorer server HTTP and HTTPS port numbers. By default, they are 7080 and 7443.
* The user ID that runs the Liberty explorer server started task.

  **Tip:** Use the same user ID that runs the z/OSMF IZUSVR1 task, or a user ID with equivalent authorizations.
